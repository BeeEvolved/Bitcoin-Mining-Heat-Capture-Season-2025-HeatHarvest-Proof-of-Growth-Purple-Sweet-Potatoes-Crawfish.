### ℹ️ Clarifications Around “Non-Commercial”
The CC BY-NC-SA definition hinges on *commercial advantage or monetary compensation*. The following are **generally considered commercial** and therefore **not allowed** without a commercial license:
- Selling prints or kits, charging “at cost + fee,” or taking commissions.  
- Paid Patreon/Shop/Maker-store releases of the files or printed parts.  
- Paywalled downloads or “members-only” file access for money or perks.  
- Using the design in a revenue-generating service or product bundle.

The following are **generally okay** (still require attribution, and ShareAlike for derivatives):
- Sharing files or build logs **for free**.  
- Non-monetized educational use, research, school projects, or makerspace classes **without fees** beyond direct material cost.  
- Non-monetized videos or posts demonstrating your build (please attribute).

When in doubt, **ask first**.
