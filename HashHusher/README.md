> **Early Beta:** 3D-print and use at your own risk. No guarantees or warranties are provided.

HashHusher reduces the noise of Bitcoin mining hardware such as the **Bitmain S19** and select **WhatsMiner** rigs. Planned revisions include threaded pipe sections for improved damping, modular mounts for add-ons, and more direct intake and exhaust paths.

## ⚠️ Beta warnings (read before use)

- **Heat & airflow:** Miners run hot. Any restriction can cause overheating. Monitor temperatures closely and stop use if temps rise abnormally.
- **Material choice:** Use heat-resistant filament (e.g., **ABS, ASA, PC**). **Do not** use PLA near exhaust paths.
- **Installation safety:** Power down and unplug equipment before fitting. Ensure secure mounting; recheck fasteners after the first hours of operation.
- **Fire safety:** Keep clearances around exhausts and away from flammables. Do not leave the setup unattended until you’ve validated stable temps.
- **Ventilation:** Provide adequate intake/exhaust and fresh air. Noise reduction will vary by room, ducts, and miner model.
- **Warranty & compliance:** Modifying airflow paths may void manufacturer warranties and may not meet local noise or building codes verify before use.
